## Welcome to Fallen-8.
Fallen-8 is an in-memory [graph database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) implemented in C#. Its focus is to provide raw speed for heavy graph algorithms.

This is the .NET Core version of the original [fallen-8](https://github.com/cosh/fallen-8). The core of fallen-8 stays unchanged but the webservices have been upgraded with a proper swagger interface.

### Key featues
* **Properties** on vertices and edges 
* **Indexes** on vertices and edges
* **Plugins** for indexes, algorithms and services
* Checkpoint **persistency**

### Sweet spots
* **Enterprise Search** (Semantic adhoc queries on multi-dimensional graphs)
* **Lawful Interception** (Mass analysis)
* **E-Commerce** (Bid- and portfolio-management)

## Samples
Start the fallen-8-core-apiApp and have fun.

### Create a sample graph

### Scan for Trent and Mallory

### Calculate the paths between Trent and Mallory
